# Final Work for Algorithms and Data Structures 2 - UFU

Final Work for Algorithms and Data Structures 1 Class, from Universidade Federal de Uberl√¢ndia - UFU.

### Get Started

It is an example of a simple social network, represented by a graph. We have 2 recording files, which are: "data.txt" and "Registro_de_Atividade.txt", the first writes all the system data (vertices and edges), the second saves the activity history (a simple log).
* Each vertex represents a user, they own their personal data.
* Each edge represents a connection between two users, one user can follow another (uni-directional edges).
